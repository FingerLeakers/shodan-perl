SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

Before you can use the API, you need to have an API key.

Get your API key here: http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc

Setup the SHODAN WebAPI:

	use Shodan::WebAPI;
	
	$api = new Shodan::WebAPI(MY_API_KEY);

Print a list of cisco-ios devices:

	$result = $api->search("cisco-ios");
	foreach $host ( @{$result->{'matches'}} ) {
		print $host{'ip'} . "\n";
	}

Get all the information SHODAN has on the IP 217.140.75.46:

	$host = $api->host('217.140.75.46');
	print $host['ip'];

Make sure to check whether the API results contain the 'error' key, and if so handle the
error appropriately:
	
	if ( $result->{'error'} ) {
		print "Error: " . $result->{'error'} . "\n";
		# Do other error-handling
	}
